Last Judgment, an unbeatable RPG, only to be met with a strange message on his screen.\n\n“Congratulations, Champion. Would you like to unlock the bonus stage?”\n\nWhen he clicks “Yes,” he is transported straight into the game world, reborn as Terence Ross, the overlooked third son of a minor noble family. Realizing he’s just an extra in a world teetering on ruin, Ren trains relentlessly to survive the coming chaos.\n\nHowever, life wasn’t smooth sailing.\n\nHe was soon engaged to Lilith Underwood, the girl destined to become the game’s final boss, the Third Great Calamity. To avoid her devastating future, Ren takes a risky approach, trying to make Lilith emotionally dependent on him in the hopes of anchoring her humanity.\n\nYet, his plan backfires spectacularly. Lilith’s attachment becomes a fierce obsession, one that could be just as dangerous as her dark powers.\n\nNow, as doom inches closer, Ren faces a double-edged crisis. He must keep Lilith’s powers in check while somehow surviving her unrelenting need to keep him by her side.\n\nIn a world where even heroes fall, can an extra rewrite his fate? Or will he be claimed by the calamity he tried to prevent?","author":"ChakraLord","artist":null,"status":"Ongoing","genres":"Fantasy,Action,Adult,Adventure,Comedy,Romance,Game","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":0,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":87,"totalChapters":87,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":null}
