After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.\n\nThrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.\n\nBut his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human.","author":"DrDoritosMD","artist":null,"status":"Ongoing","genres":"Adventure,Fantasy,Action,Comedy,Seinen","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":0,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":21,"totalChapters":21,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":null}
