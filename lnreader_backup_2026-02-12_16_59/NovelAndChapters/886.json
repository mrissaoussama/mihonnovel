However, instead of returning as a player, he finds himself reincarnated as an NPC within the game.Now functioning with all the traits and systems of an NPC, Felix becomes a legendary figure among players. To them, he is:A mysterious merchantA dreamlike mentorAn unattainable ideal for countless female playersWithin the world of Terra, Felix is more than just an NPC—he is seen as a spiritual guide, a false priest, a dreamer, a philosopher, a reformer, a philanthropist, a loner, a seeker, an explorer, and a pioneer.His motto:\"Let the players enjoy the game—while I profit from every second they do.\"---Quotes from notable figures in the game:Jeston: “I could take two or three punches from Saria, but I wouldn’t dare take even one from Felix. Even if God ordered me to, I’d go to war with Him instead.”Arturia: “Felix’s presence makes me want to perform before him for three days and three nights, without rest.”Patriot: “Your ideals… they are reality.”MacArthur, a five-star American operator, once remarked:“All it takes is a single move from him, and he’ll dominate the entire Terra Daily hot search list. The moment I saw Felix on the battlefield, I knew—there was no turning back.” ","author":"Dhani_Pratama_2945","artist":null,"status":"Ongoing","genres":"Other","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":0,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":438,"totalChapters":438,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":"2026-01-12 04:48:27"}
