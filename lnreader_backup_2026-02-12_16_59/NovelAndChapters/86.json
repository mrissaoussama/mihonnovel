His or her nature lead to the birth of her own daughter. Now, together with her daughter, she discovers the laws of a reality with a natural energy called mana, while constantly trying to fix the issues her actions lead to. \nThis is the first time that I write anything on the scale of a book/novel and I am not a native english speaker, so the tense might be a bit wobbly and some things might just sound really odd for you. I can take some critic on my writing though, as I am aware that I'm not that good at it. I know where I want to go with my story, but as I have no script I have a lot of freedom.\nThe rewrite is done let's throw a party! (Though without me, I'm shy)\nUpdate schedule: every 3 days\nThanks for reading!\n","author":"Otjag","artist":"","status":"Ongoing","genres":"Action,Adventure,Fantasy,Isekai,LitRPG,Mature,Romance,Slice of Life","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":0,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":0,"totalChapters":0,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":null}
