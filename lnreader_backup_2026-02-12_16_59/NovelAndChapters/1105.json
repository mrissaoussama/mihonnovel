It's a boulder of truth, and it's about to roll onto the world.Humanity has forgotten the ancient ways of magic, ritual, and the occult, as mana has disappeared from the world over the past millennia. Once-powerful creatures are now remembered as silly cryptids. Organizations that, in ancient times, guided the world of mortals from the shadows have now turned into conspiracy theories, and powerful rituals and ancient gods have become nothing more than superstition and old beliefs.But the universe never stays constant, and change is inevitable. Magic begins to make its return, as mythical creatures start to crawl out from their hidden lairs, the Ouija boards start summoning real demons, and college Halloween haunted-house parties turn into real horrors. The world slowly descends into chaos.But all of this isn't bad news for everyone. This is a breath of fresh air to Samuel, the last remaining member of a once-infamous wizard family known for their strange deals with Eldritch gods. Following in his ancestors' footsteps, he embarks on a path to the pinnacle of magic and dark arts. The chaos will transform his work as an exorcist from explaining to old ladies that their cat vomiting on the carpet is not a sign of possession to fighting some proper ghosts and demons.The exorcist business is about to boom, but is this a good thing for the rest of the world?What to expect:- Slow descent of society into chaos- An extensive magic system based on knowledge, occult, and ritual- Paranormal investigations- Competent and morally grey protagonist- Lovecraftian abomination here and there- Horror and mystery elements- The litRPG elements as part of the world rather than a system- Regular updates on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays- No harem ","author":"Hastum","artist":null,"status":"Ongoing","genres":"Adventure,Fantasy,Horror,Mystery,Magic,Supernatural","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":1,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":146,"totalChapters":146,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":null}
