Vainqueur's only pleasure in life is to watch his treasure get bigger, one coin at a time.\nSo when a would-be thief turned unwilling minion tells him about \"classes,\" \"levels,\" and \"quests,\" Vainqueur wonders if maybe, just maybe, he should consider a career change. \nAfter all, why bother hunting monsters for free when you can get paid for it?","author":"Maxime J.
