What’s more, I was in the form of the female avatar I used in the game.All around me was an endless ocean, with no iron, no fuel, no energy, nothing at all! No matter how advanced sci-fi technology is, without resources, nothing can be made.Despite this, the natives use some sort of incomprehensible technology called magic, and there’s not a trace of science to be found.Most importantly, I want to eat proper meals for nourishment, not just survive on IV drips!This is the story of a TS girl surviving in a fantasy world together with a super-advanced but spoiled AI administrator.","author":"Tentenko","artist":null,"status":"Ongoing","genres":"Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Adventure","inLibrary":1,"isLocal":0,"totalPages":4,"chaptersDownloaded":0,"chaptersUnread":25,"totalChapters":25,"lastReadAt":null,"lastUpdatedAt":null}
