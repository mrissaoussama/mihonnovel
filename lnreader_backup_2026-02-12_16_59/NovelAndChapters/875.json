Thus, a supremely popular villain, outstanding in appearance, formidable in strength, and delightful in personality, quickly emerged.Here are his abilities:Stellar Eclipse Eye: This ability allows for 100% observation of one's own and the target's \"energy flow,\" enabling a 1-second pre-cognition of an opponent's next move in combat.Vector Control: This grants the ability to control the movement vectors of touched objects (e.g., the direction of an attack's impact, the path of energy flow).Hyper-computation: This puts the brain into a \"hyper-frequency state,\" allowing for the simultaneous simulation of tens of thousands of deduction results to find the guaranteed winning solution.Super high popularity brought super strength, and super strength, in turn, brought super high popularity. Many years later, Tendo Simei, who \"arduously\" reached the pinnacle of the Stars through his \"talent\" and \"effort,\" delivered an MVP acceptance speech befitting his character:\"Rules? Those are shackles prepared for the weak. I, Tendo Simei, only follow the laws of my own heart.\"I handpick only the finest and most captivating novels for you.
