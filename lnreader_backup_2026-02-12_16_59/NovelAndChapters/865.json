It is recommended that you read both to understand the full world building. It’s not necessary to read both to understand individual stories, however.]He can’t conjure grief, can barely levitate a pebble, and once submitted a stanza instead of a spell schematic. Meet Fabrisse Kestovar: aspiring thaumaturge rock collector, confirmed pastry enthusiast, professional bird whisperer, and perhaps the least emotionally competent student in the Order’s seven-hundred-year history.Which makes it all the more confusing when an ancient magical relic suddenly wakes up after forty-seven years of silence, launches itself across a holy sanctum, and crashes into his face.Now bonded to a forgotten epochal calibration system buried beneath layers of ritual and myth, Fabrisse gains access to the PRAXIS NODE, a long-dormant, possibly AI-driven interface that delivers cryptic quests, sarcastic prompts, and calibration objectives measured in light-years. He has a Legacy Token, no combat thresholds, and a growing collection of useless rocks the system insists are ‘historically significant.’He’s also the only one who can see any of it.Features:Weak to less weak to (maybe) strong MCA magic system based on emotional resonanceA cosmic tutorial disguised as a sacred riteSystem messages with a personality disorderBalance between crunchy numbers and intuitive magic learningSlow-burn progression, and slow-burn romanceSpell mnemonics that rhyme on purposeA chosen one who really, really shouldn’t beAnd the ugliest magic rocks you’ve ever seenFind me on my Discord server (a shared server with other fics I write)!Also posted on ScribbleHub and Fenrirealm.
