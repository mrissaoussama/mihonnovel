He’s a lazy dragon. A thrill-seeker at best. A nap enthusiast at worst.Ten days of lying in a forest taught him only two things: bears are dumb, and monkeys need to stop getting freaky with trees.That is, until someone walked into his life.Suddenly, the dragon with no past had a name. A reason to get up.And maybe, just maybe… a reason to stop roasting everything that annoys him.He’ll conquer women with a smile, kingdoms with a claw, and his enemies with the kind of casual cruelty only a dragon lounging on a throne could manage.He’s not just rising to power—He’s going to become a god.And he’s going to enjoy every second of it........................................................Additional tags: Slice of Life, Kingdom building, world jumps (quite late), no-NTR, and no-Yuri.
